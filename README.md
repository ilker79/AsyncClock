School of Code adventure, 2nd Week.

After learning more about JavaScript and async functions. I completed the tasks described below to make the clock tick. Most of the HTML and CSS were pre-coded by SoC coaches. I wrote the functionality in JavaScript and added minute and hour hands. I enjoyed making the clock work very much.

# What makes you tick?

In this challenge, you will be using your newfound knowledge of setInterval to make the hand of this clock tick. Break down the problem, make a plan, and then translate it into code.

## Requirements

- You should use setInterval.
- The hand should move round the clock every second and should complete a full revolution in 60 seconds.
- You should adjust the rotation of the hand using the transform property as demonstrated in `main.js`.

## Bonus

- Use the JS Date object to get the real seconds.
- Add a minute hand.
- Add an hour hand.
